code++ for "the photon" and node.js scripts

Hand robotics.
The hand is 3D printed with the model from: http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Robotic-Hand-Controlled-by-a-Glove-and-Arduino/



FaceHandSymbols.js : A script, listening on facebook chat for new emojis and shows them as fysical gestures.

Known bugs: Anything the script cant interpret wil be acsepted as thumsup.
Planed features: Adding slack support.



The Photon Code: The code running on The Photon. Could be more compact and less if-else looking. Works like a clock.
Note: the servos can go a total of 180 Deg, but due to fysical limitations on the 3D printed had and the pulling needed its only set to a maximum of 90 Deg. The midle finger is alsow inverted for the same reasons.

known bugs: None.
Planed features: Fiksing mekanikal limitations on the 3D printed hand to fully utelise the joints.


General Planed Ides:
Making a new glove so the user can controle the hand, just for funn.
